Band A is about data in context.

Band A is about the usability of data.

* Band A is about data in context.
* Confirmatory data analysis
* Consider appropriateness of a given data set to answer a particular
question or to be subject to a particular analysis.

Band A may require the acquisition of new data sets or work in annotation to make the data usable. Each of those data sets may need to go through the full process. 

Whereas Band B might involve characterising the missing values, Band A could involve modelling them. 

At the end of Band A the data set is ready for RAMP, Kaggle, etc
