Band B is about the validity of the data. Checking the faithfulness and representation. It can include components of exploratory data analysis.

## What does it include?

* visualisations.
* noise characterisation.
* Missing values.
* entity disambiguation, record linkage, duplicate detection
* anomaly detection

## Examples

* Was a column or columns accidentally perturbed (e.g. through a sort operation that missed one or more columns)?
* Was a [gene name accidentally converted to a date](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80)?


At the end of Band B, ready to define a candidate question, the context.
