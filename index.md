# Data Readiness Levels

The intention is for Data Readiness Levels to be a set of terms used to characterize the
readiness of data for deployment.

For the moment we have described three bands of data readiness, within
each band, there will be sub bands, and one role of this site is to
achieve consensus on what those sub bands (and bands) should represent
so that data readiness levels can be deployed across a wide range of
applications.

Typically, all data starts at sub-band C4, "hearsay data", meaning
that people have heard that the data exists, so they say it does. The
ultimate aim, is to bring a data set to A1, at this subband the data
is ready for deployment or productionization. 

To explore each band go to the associated pages above. You can make
suggestions for changes to band or sub-band descriptions through github pull requests.
